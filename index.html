#### Taxpayers are required to submit tax reports from February 1st to March 31st.

- and we'll talk a lot about it today.

#### 💡 Low WiP reduces lead time, reduces risks, and improves teamwork
???
reduces lead time = accelerates delivery of value.

--

#### 💡 Focus as many people as possible on as few projects/stories/tasks as possible
???
remember how it's called in Scrum? Swarming :-)

--

#### 💡 *Stop starting. Start finishing*. 

Set explicit WiP limits so that developers focus on completing existing stories, instead of starting new stories. If WiP limit is reached, nobody is allowed to take new work. Everybody should be *helping finish the existing work*, eliminate process bottlenecks, or slack.

--
- WiP limits minimize batching.
- WiP limits turn on "swarming" and force people to collaborate more (also across the roles).
- Total WiP < of people in the team.

#### ( = due date performance)

![:ribbon Challenge]
## What happens when the team stops delivering promised work on time?

--

![](phoenix.jpg)
???
- pressure! what happens next?
- to accept MAX work for utilization or even more (to please customer).
- reinforcing loop: slow -> more pressure, more work
- low quality, corners cut, debt goes up
- no buffer to accomodate uncertaincy, missed deadlines
- how people feel?
- no innovation time

---

### 🖐️ 10 rules of delivering to the promise with Scrum:

--

##### 1. Know your **velocity** (how much work you can comfortably deliver w/o cutting corners)

--

##### 2. Even under pressure, never take more work than allowed by your velocity

--

##### 3. Remove planned work when unplanned work pops up (and remember to inform impacted stakeholders)

--

##### 4. Minimize the amount of unplanned work

--

##### 5. Estimate with *relative complexity points* (0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, ∞) and drop numbers from the seq to gain speed at the cost of precision

--

##### 6. Play planning poker until all team members' estimates match. Reduce HiPPO pressure.

--

##### 7. When estimation is difficult or the problem is too big, *split it* or use *spikes*. Minimize unknowns instead of guessing in blind.

--

##### 8. Because estimates are imprecise, comfortable velocity must include a buffer. Don't ~~f**kup~~ inflate estimates to make a buffer.
???
- “developer workweek is 40 hours. 3 devs in a team. Why velocity is not 120 hours? What are you doing in the remaining time?” and dozens of problems caused by this wrong, but obvious relationship: 
- planning for maximum hours utilization (120 hours and zero slack), 
- for Villis it takes only 1 hour because he is senior, but for Eduards it’s 3 days because he is junior, yada-yada…
- purposefully inflating estimates to get some slack
- explaining to the customer what is pair programming : ) Relative complexity estimation doesn’t have this problem.
- instead of spending time on determining exact hours, better spend time on story slicing.

--

##### 9. Turn on swarming for speed and continuous flow. Monitor the flow with The Burndown Chart and Kanban board

--

##### 10. Keep technical debt under control

## 💡 Velocity must include slack.
???
- buffer to accomodate uncertaincy (bad estimate, production issue). Otherwise you can't deliver to promises.
- pay off technical debt / refactoring
- time for your teammates to create presentation, a training, watch video, read a book. Your team will thank you :)
- technical experimentation, R&D (R&D days don't work.) 
- business incubation (who else will do this, if not you? Business will thank you.)

## **Throughput and technical debt**

---
class: center, middle
### 💡 There is a strong correlation between the quality of the codebase and **throughput**.

???
- Can someone explain why throughput drops faster (exponentially) than it increases?
### Reinforcing loops:
- Broken window theory
- Lehman's Law: as a system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it. (as we add functionality);
- Brook's Law
- Gresham's Law (bad components drive out good components)
### 
- The rule that makes throughput gradually improve? 
- The (Boy)Scout Rule.

---

### - Encourage
???
- not discourage != encourage
- help reach people their potential. People are in self-doubt.
- exercise: say the the group that you are awesome. Mention name. Say WHY you are awesome.

### Thanks for raising this. Before we make any big moves, what if you organize a Kotlin workshop? **Once the team is comfortable with Kotlin, I can help convicing CTO.**

### - Share
???
- tool, framework, lib, oss project

- blogs
- videos
- online courses
- brownbags
- meetups
- tech community (btw you can create your own)
- people to follow
- training
- energy
- optimism!

--

### - Set rules
???
- Explicit WiP limits.
- CI and trunk-based development (no isolation, forces to test, small chunks = easier code review)
- TDD
- YBIYRI
- Shorter sprints (even one day!)
- No Product Owner.
- Definition or Done (passes tests, deployed to prod and has a feature toggle, has documentation, demo prepared)
- Mandatory Code Review.
- Scout's Rule (with metrics can't go lower than now)
- No junk in the trunk.
- Always pairing.
- Every time new pair.

--

### - Do together
???
- not telling what to do, but actually doing together. The best way to convince, is to do together (and show :-)

# Pair Programming
![](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386925310l/67833.jpg)
???
- 1+1>2.Best idea + best idea = Third idea even better. 
- leveling, kills experts.
- to build relationship, you learn about each other, team bonding (small, stable, JELLED team)
- building common values / language
- reduces ego
- amplifies learning (tricks, shmicks...) - MASTERY!
- rubber duck built in
- onboarding :-)
- better end solution and design
- fewer defects, caught early
- fewer assumptions
- focus (less FB distraction :-)
- code is better because someone is watching (i come prepared.)
- to lead by example (use TDD! or "HE DOESNT USE TDD" aha...)
- to resolve disagreements, FORCES to discuss, understand, agree to proceed.
- protection against Sunk Cost Fallacy
- more fun cutting through boring tasks / shitty code
- knowledge transfer (lower bus factor, no knowledge silos, 2 ppl ready to change)
- eliminates code reviews, interruptions caused by it.
- eliminates code reviews that ALWAYS lead to rework (code review ping-pong)
- eliminates code review where the reviewer NEVER understands code well enough.

## What skills to grow?
???
sometimes we push things that people don't want.

--

#### - P2P review

--

#### - Know your peers' interests/career goals

--

#### - Inspire interests/career goals yourself

--

#### - HTC rule

--

#### - One-on-ones
???
- open door policy doesn't work...
- what's your goal?! I want to help. SERVANT LEADERSHIP. I GIVE A SHIT.
- to grow in this company or become the top engineer, I suggest...
- is there anything that you don't like?
- have a walk, have a coffee, do sports. Especially with those who don't support you.
