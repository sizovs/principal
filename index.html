### (1/2) Backlog Item #JR-1234:
#### Taxpayers are required to submit tax reports from February 1st to March 31st. Every year, during that period, our system becomes unstable, as taxpayers rush to submit documents as soon as possible. Since our webserver can't keep up with the load, make the system more scalable by re-implementing blocking code with reactive programming.

### (2/2) Backlog Item #JR-2345:
#### As a business analyst, I want to have a rich and convenient UI so that non-technical (internal) users and I could query any information from the database, analyze data, and build visual reports. The interface must support complex data queries, filtering, and charts.

---
class: center, middle
### A good backlog item describes a problem, not a specific solution. The team decides how to solve the problem *cost-effieciently*.
#### ⚠️ Spoon-feeding a team with specific solutions leads to low motivation, low innovation culture, and mediocre software solutions.

![:ribbon Challenge]
## What happens when the team stops delivering promised work on time?

--

![](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361113128l/17255186.jpg)
???
- pressure! what happens next?
- to accept MAX work for utilization or even more (to please customer).
- reinforcing loop: slow -> more pressure, more work
- low quality, corners cut, debt goes up
- no buffer to accomodate uncertaincy, missed deadlines
- how people feel?
- no innovation time

---

## 🖐️ 5 rules of delivering to the promise with Scrum:

--

#### 1. Know your *velocity* (how much work you can comfortably deliver w/o cutting corners)

--

#### 2. Even under pressure, never take more work than allowed by your velocity.

--

#### 3. Every unplanned work added causes removal of planned work (inform stakeholders!)

--

#### 4. Estimate with planning poker (0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ∞).

--

#### 5. When estimation is impossible, use spikes (no guessing).

---
class: center, middle, bad
### Estimates are evil (and are not needed).

---
class: center, middle, oki
### Estimates are not evil. We estimate to know how much work we can comfortably take, and to feel good when we deliver it on time.

---
class: center, middle, bad
### Sprint is not a committment.

---
class: white
background-image:url(bullshitometer.png)
background-size: contain

---
class: center, middle, oki
### Sprint is a commitment stakeholders can rely on. Scrum (and XP) gives you all the necessary tools to meet the commitment.

---
class: center, middle, bad
### But I am being assigned too much work...

---
class: center, middle, oki
### Work cannot be assigned; it can only be accepted. If someone tries to give you responsibility, only you can decide if you are responsible or if you aren’t.
#### – eXtreme Programming Explained (Kent Beck)

---
class: center, middle
# 💡 Velocity must include slack.
???
- buffer to accomodate uncertaincy (bad estimate, production issue). Otherwise you can't deliver to promises.
- pay off technical debt / refactoring
- time for your teammates to create presentation, a training, watch video, read a book. Your team will thank you :)
- technical experimentation, R&D (R&D days don't work.) 
- business incubation (who else will do this, if not you? Business will thank you.)
- optimize for wow (surprise time!)

#### 💡 Focus as many people as possible on as few projects/stories/tasks as possible.
#### 💡 Make all work visible.
#### 💡 *Stop starting. Start finishing*. 

Set explicit WiP limits so that developers focus on completing existing stories, instead of starting new stories. If WiP limit is reached, nobody is allowed to take new work. Everybody should be *helping finish the existing work*, eliminate process bottlenecks, or slack.

it's not often life gives us opportunity to impact people's lives in a positive way. And even less so at work. Helping people overcome their fears, believing in them and making them believe in themselves, supporting their growth. One of the most rewarding and lasting experiences.

### **Leveling** team competences (bus factor, throughput, autonomy)
???
- reduce bus factor, optimize for replaceability
- no bottlenecks due to specialization of experts
- build a team that adapts to varying demand
